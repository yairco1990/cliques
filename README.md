# cliques
submission 2 in mivne tohna

this project desigened to find Cliques in undirected graphs.
for this purpose we have several classes
class name VertexSet is the basic class. every vertex set is actually a Clique of connetced verteces.
class name Clique is the mid class. every Clique has VertexSet of all the verteces beongs to this Clique and another VertexSet of all it's neighbors.
class name Graph is the primary class. this class creates the grpah, from a square table of numbers according to specific TH.
or from a graph csv file format.
there are several methods in this class:
- finding specific Cliques between known range
- Creating a graph by the DFS algorithm
- finding the max avaliable Clique in this graph.
- calculating the Edges and the Verteces in the graph.
- and writing all the scores to a csv file.
